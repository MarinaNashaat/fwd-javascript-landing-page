# Landing Page Project

This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.


## Table of Contents
- Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty ul and dynamically build navigation using Append, appendChild, and innerHTML.

- while scrolling through the page it appear which section is being viewed using .getBoundingClientRect() 

- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scroll smoothly to the appropriate section.
You can use the following methods to fulfill this criterion:

- scroll top button to scroll back to top , it appears while scrolling bottom

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
